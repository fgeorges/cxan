                                    README



     This directory is dedicated to a CXAN sandbox.  Don't store anything
   valuable in here.  The sandbox can be deleted, restarted, re-created at any
   time without any notice.  This sandbox is a local sandbox, mainly aimed at
   doing some tests locally, while developing.  There is also a sub-directory
   cxan-sandbox/, which contains a descriptor and a Makefile to build the
   sandbox at http://test.cxan.org/ (this is another story though).

     It must contain a sub-directory apache-tomcat-7.0.27/.  This directory
   itself is not added to the Subversion repository though.  Take care NOT to
   add it yourself.  It must contain as well a subdir exist-2.0-tech-preview/
   with eXist installed through its graphical installer (with the password
   'admin' for admin).

1. Tomcat config

 1.1 conf/catalina.properties

     Added the prop org.expath.servlex.repo.dir:

       org.expath.servlex.repo.dir=/absolute/dir/to/cxan/sandbox/repo

 1.2 conf/server.xml

     I've changed the ports 8005, 8080, 8443 and 8009 to resp. 9075,
   9070, 9473 and 9079:

 1.3 conf/tomcat-users.xml

     I've added the config for the user admin with password "admin":

       <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
       <role rolename="admin-script"/>
       <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
       <role rolename="manager-script"/>
       <user username="admin" password="admin"
             roles="admin-gui,admin-script,manager-gui,manager-script"/>

2. eXist config

     I've changed the ports 8080 and 8443 to resp. 7070 and 7473 in the Jetty
   config at tools/jetty/etc/jetty.xml.  Then go to the user manager from the
   dashboard and add the group 'cxan', then add the user 'cxan' with the
   password 'cxan' in the group cxan without any home collection.

     Change also the property 'uri' in client.properties (change the port 8080
   to 7070).  Still you need to pass the password to shutdown.sh (using "-p").

     Create the collection /db/cxan/, with the owner cxan and the group cxan,
   and the ability for the user cxan to write in it.  Add the documents in
   misc/db/ to /db/cxan/ (that is, the empty packages.xml and categories.xml
   with the tree of categories).
